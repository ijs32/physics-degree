# Physics Programs

While pursuing my physics degree, I plan to write programs to solidify concepts learned in class through code when possible.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal collection of Python programs, Jupyter notebooks, and computational exercises related to various topics in my physics curriculum. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific class or major concept.

## Structure

  * `src/linear_algebra/`: Code and notebooks for linear algebra concepts.
  * `src/calc_III/`: (Starts this fall)
  * `src/phys_II/`: (Starts this fall)
  * ...and so on for other classes/topics.

## Getting Started

To run the programs and notebooks in this repository, you'll need Python and Poetry installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/physics-code.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd physics-code
    ```
2.  **Install Poetry dependencies:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
3.  **Activate the Poetry environment:**
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    # OR (copy and paste the output of this command if 'poetry shell' doesn't work for your setup)
    # poetry env activate
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook (optional, for notebooks):**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
