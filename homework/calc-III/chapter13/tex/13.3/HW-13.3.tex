    \item Traveling waves (for example, water waves or electromagnetic waves) exhibit periodic motion in both time and position. In one dimension (for example, a wave on a string), wave motion is governed by the one-dimensional wave equation below, where $u(x,t)$ is the height or displacement of the wave surface at position x and time t, and c is the constant speed of the wave. Show that $u(x,t)$ given below is a solution of the wave equation.
    \[
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, u(x,t) = 6\cos(5(x + ct)) + 7\sin(x - ct)
    \]
